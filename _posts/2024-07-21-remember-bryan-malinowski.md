**Summary:** Bryan Malinowski was a director of the airport in Little Rock, AR. On March 19, 2024 he was shot in his home by ATF Agents

**Why this matters**
Firearm ownership is a lawful activity protected by the Second Ammendment, and it has a vibrant and diverse community of people for whom it is a major part of their life. While some just own a firearm as a tool, others make it into a full time hobby, whether for collecting, sport, hunting or self defense. These folks go to gun shows, belong to gun clubs, own hunting licenses, read gun magazines, argue online over merits of 55, 62, or 77 bullet weights. Bryan was one of those people, and so am I. As a community, we follow the rules, and if we want them changed, we vote. We also take responsibility for our families' safety seriously and if you burst into our homes unannounced in the middle of the night, there is a good chance we will assume it is a home invasion and you are going to have a firefight on your hands. Not that any gun community member is going to intentionally pick a fight with law enforcement, but the surprise violent entry in the middle of the night is the kind of situation where misidentification is likely to happen. This is all public knowledge and by choosing this path, the officials are getting as close to a targetted assasination as possible, without calling it by that name. In addition to being a personal tragedy for Bryan and his family, this is also an act intended to terrorize the community of voters and law abiding citizens.

First, I'd like to point out that I am not receiving any money, not even to cover my costs. I am not affiliated with any parties involved, and I am doing this purely out of my own initiative to speak up on an issue that is important but not receiving sufficient attention.
